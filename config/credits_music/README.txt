The enclosed /sounds folder holds the sound files used as the title music for the game. OGG and WAV are supported.

Using unnecessarily huge sounds can cause client side lag and should be avoided.

You may add as many credits sounds as you like, if there is more than one a random screen is chosen (see name conventions for specifics).

All credits music entries require an accompanying json in the /jsons folder. These contain information such as the name of the song and the author, as well as if the song is "rare" or map-specific. Example in /jsons.
