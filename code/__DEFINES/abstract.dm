/**
* Abstract-ness is a meta-property of a class that is used to indicate
* that the class is intended to be used as a base class for others, and
* should not (or cannot) be instantiated.
* We have no such language concept in DM, and so we provide a datum member
* that can be used to hint at abstractness for circumstances where we would
* like that to be the case, such as base behavior providers.
